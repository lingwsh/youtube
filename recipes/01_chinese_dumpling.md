Stir, then add half a bowl of water in two parts. Heat the meat mixture in the bowl in the microwave for 30 seconds. If there is not enough salt, add a little more salt.

### Dumpling skin
- Knead the dough again, then put it into a container and rest for another hour.
- After one hour, take the dough out then cut a 2.5 cm wide dough, roll it into a cylinder and cut it into smaller pieces of dough. 
- Then form each small dough into a cylinder and then add some flour and press it down. 
- Using a rolling pin, form the dough into a dumpling skin. If the dumpling skin is not very round, it will not affect the dumpling wrapping.

### Wrapping dumplings
- Place the dumpling in the middle of the dumpling skin, or less if you are not skilled.
- Then pinch the dumpling skin tightly from the middle.
- Then pinch the left side and right side separately.
- Place the dumplings on a flat surface dusted with flour and laid with kitchen paper.

### Frying dumplings
- Add some canola oil to a pan and turn on medium heat (Fire level 7 if max fire is 9).
- When the oil is evenly spread in the bottom of the pan, add the dumplings. Keep a certain distance between the dumplings, because the dumplings will get bigger after heating.
- Drizzle 1/3 bowl of cold water over the dumplings.
- You can use a cutting board or baking pan if you don't have a suitable lid.
- Uncover the pan and keep heating for another 3 minutes before taking out the dumplings with a flat spatula.
- You can use Italian vinegar together with regular vinegar as a dip for the dumplings. The vinegar will help digest the dumplings because you will be eating a lot of delicious dumplings.

### Frozen dumplings
- Line the freezer drawer with plastic wrap, then sprinkle with flour and place the extra dumplings in the freezer. 
- Once the dumplings are frozen, you can put them in a bag and keep them for a long time. You can boil and fry dumplings in the same way.

### Boiling dumplings
- Add frozen or fresh dumplings to the boiling water.
- When the water boils again, gently stir to prevent the dumplings from sticking.
- Then add 1/4 bowl of cold water to the re-boiled dumplings.
- Add 1/4 bowl of cold water again after boiling.
- Bring to a boil, turn off the heat, do not open the lid, and let rest for 5 minutes.
- Serve one dumpling and taste it. If the dumpling is not cooked through you can wait 2 minutes longer.
- Prepare the same balsamic vinegar plus regular vinegar for dipping, add some white pepper if you like.
